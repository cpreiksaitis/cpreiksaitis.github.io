    <h2>EMPYEMA</h2>
    <h3>Introduction and Epidemiology</h3>
    <p>Empyema is pus in the pleural space. A parapneumonic effusion is a pleural effusion associated with a lung infection, usually pneumonia but infrequently a lung abscess. Bacterial pneumonia with a parapneumonic effusion is the most common precursor, seen in about 60% of empyema patients.<sup>1</sup> Other causes of empyema are complications of chest surgery (22%), trauma (4%), esophageal perforation (4%), complications of chest tube/thoracentesis (4%), an extension from a subdiaphragmatic infection (3%), and assorted triggers (7%), including a hemothorax, chylothorax, or hydrothorax that becomes infected due to a systemic infection with hematogenous spread such as septicemia.<sup>1,2</sup></p>
    <p>Of the approximately 1 million pneumonia patients hospitalized each year in the United States, 20% to 40% develop a parapneumonic effusion; 5% to 10% of patients with a parapneumonic effusion develop an empyema.<sup>3,4</sup> Mortality in adults is about 20%.<sup>5</sup> With the advent of antibiotics, the incidence of empyema decreased in the first half of the 20th century, but since the 1990s, the incidence of empyema has increased in the United States and worldwide.<sup>3,6</sup></p>
    <p>Predisposing factors for empyema include aspiration (and the conditions causing this event, notably altered swallowing), respiratory disease impairing ciliary function, immunocompromise, malignancy, IV drug abuse, alcoholism, diabetes, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and poor oral hygiene.<sup>1</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h3>Clinical Features</h3>
    <p>Suspect empyema if symptoms of pneumonia (fever, cough, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and malaise) do not resolve with therapy. The onset of empyema may be insidious, with patients appearing chronically ill with weight loss, anemia, and night sweats.<sup>3</sup></p>
    <p>Physical examination findings include decreased breath sounds, dullness to percussion, decreased tactile fremitus, and occasionally a friction rub.<sup>7</sup> Pain from an underlying effusion or empyema may cause splinting with respiration. If there is an underlying pulmonary infection, rales or rhonchi may exist.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
    <p>Diagnostic criteria for empyema are aspiration of grossly purulent material on thoracentesis and at least one of the following: thoracentesis fluid with a positive Gram stain or culture, pleural fluid glucose &lt;40 milligrams/dL, pH &lt;7.2, or lactate dehydrogenase &gt;1000 IU/L. For empyema from tuberculosis, absolute lymphocyte count on pleural fluid is useful, although other markers such as interferon release assays or adenosine deaminase show promise.<sup>4</sup> Pleural biopsy is diagnostic in 55% to 70% of patients, demonstrating a granuloma and/or being culture positive.<sup>4</sup></p>
    <p>A pleural-based opacity on a chest radiograph, including a lateral decubitus film, suggests a pleural effusion or empyema. POCUS accurately identifies pleural effusions and empyemas, differentiates a loculated effusion from a mass, and guides thoracentesis and chest tube placement. A chest CT scan with IV contrast can assess for a loculated effusion or empyema and identify any other abnormalities present.</p>
    
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h3>Treatment</h3>
    <p>The definitive treatment of an empyema is drainage and antibiotics.3,8 In addition, treat any underlying disease, especially pneumonia. NSAIDs or opioids can decrease pleuritic pain. Thoracentesis and drainage aid in the diagnosis and provide symptomatic relief for dyspnea. The common organisms in empyema stratified by associated pathology are listed in Table 1.<sup>2,9</sup> In about 40% of cases, cultures are negative,<sup>10</sup> and anaerobic species are particularly difficult to culture. Newer molecular analysis or nucleic acid amplification technology may lead to a higher detection rate for the underlying pathogen(s).</p>

    <p>The choice of antibiotics depends on the clinical presentation, local patterns, and results of diagnostic studies including cultures. Most antibiotics have adequate penetration into the pleural space with the exception of the aminoglycosides.<sup>11</sup> The detection of an aerobic organism does not preclude antibiotic coverage for anaerobes because there is a 23% incidence of mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections, according to one study.<sup>12</sup> Thus, empiric antibiotic coverage usually includes anaerobic coverage as well as coverage for other pathogens as indicated by the clinical situation, at least initially until culture results are known.</p>
    <p>Choices for empiric therapy for anaerobes include a β-lactam with β-lactamase activity, such as piperacillin-tazobactam or ampicillin-sulbactam, a carbapenem, or clindamycin. Options for gram-negative aerobic pathogens are a second- or third-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole, a carbapenem, or a β-lactam aminopenicillin with β-lactamase activity (e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam or ampicillin-sulbactam). There are many antibiotic options for gram-positive organisms including a β-lactam, with the exception of coverage for methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, which requires vancomycin or other antibiotics that cover methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em>. In patients with postprocedure or hospital-acquired empyema, consider coverage for methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>. Initial therapy often consists of two antibiotics to cover both <em>Staphylococcus</em> and anaerobes; monotherapy with a penicillin derivative or metronidazole is inadequate coverage. After initial drainage of the empyema plus IV antibiotics, switch to oral agents until there is clinical and radiographic improvement. Modify empiric antibiotics once culture results return and the clinical course is apparent.</p>
    <p>Fibrinolytics (e.g., urokinase, alteplase, or streptokinase) can improve drainage of loculated parapneumonic effusions and empyemas. The Multicenter Intrapleural Streptokinase Trial (MIST) 1 used intrapleural streptokinase, and MIST 2 used alteplase and DNAase for pleural infection.<sup>13,14</sup> The results are mixed, making fibrinolytics an option that may lessen the frequency of later surgical intervention.<sup>15-17</sup> A blinded randomized trial comparing double placebo, alteplase and DNase, alteplase and placebo, or DNAase and placebo found that DNase alone or alteplase alone was ineffective, but the combination of alteplase and DNase improved fluid drainage, decreased the frequency of surgical referral, and decreased the length of hospital stay.<sup>15</sup></p>
    <p>About one third of patients treated with antibiotics and chest tube drainage need surgical drainage.<sup>15</sup> The MIST 1 found no difference in mortality or need for thoracic surgery between large (15F to 20F), medium (10F to 14F), or small (&lt;10F) tubes, but did report that pain was much decreased with the smaller tube sizes.<sup>14</sup> Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery allows debriding of empyemas that fail tube thoracostomy drainage and antibiotic therapy. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery can be followed by or converted to a thoracotomy if pleural fluid drainage remains insufficient.</p>

    <h2>LUNG ABSCESS</h2>
    <h3>Introduction and Pathophysiology</h3>
    <p>Lung abscess is characterized by localized necrosis of the lung parenchyma and is typically caused by suppurative microbial infection. Initial infection is usually caused by aspiration of oral contents. Type 3 <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>S. aureus</em> are major causes of lung abscess, with an increasing frequency of <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> infection.<sup>17</sup> In a Japanese study, <em>Streptococcus spp.</em> (59.8%), anaerobes (26.2%), and <em>Gemella spp.</em> (9.8%) all existed in community-acquired lung abscesses.<sup>18</sup> <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> and <em>Actinomycetes spp</em>. were more common in lung abscesses that extended to the chest wall.<sup>18</sup></p>
    <p>Primary lung abscess can occur in individuals in good health or in those prone to aspiration. Approximately 80% of lung abscesses are primary,<sup>19</sup> and the overall reported mortality rate varies between 1% and 38.2%.<sup>18,20,21</sup> Secondary lung abscess is associated with malignancy, immunosuppression, extrapulmonary infection, sepsis, or complications of surgery. The mortality rate in secondary lung abscess is often &gt;50%. Lung abscesses present for &lt;1 month are termed acute, and those present for &gt;1 month are chronic.<sup>19</sup></p>
    <p>Lung abscess may also develop as a result of hematogenous spread of infectious material to the lung parenchyma or complicating lung infarction. Think of hematogenous spread from another infectious focus, such as endocarditis, in those with multiple lung abscesses. Other less common causes of pulmonary abscess include penetrating chest trauma or fungal and parasitic infections. Primary and metastatic neoplasms and inflammatory conditions such as Wegner’s granulomatosis and sarcoidosis may also manifest as pulmonary cavitary lesions and become infected (Table 2).</p>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Clinical Features</h3>
    <p>Lung abscess typically has an indolent course, with patients presenting after 2 to 4 weeks of symptoms. Symptoms include cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, weight loss, and night sweats. The development of the infection is slow, so fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea are often absent. The cough may or may not be productive.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
    <p>Chest radiograph may show an area of dense consolidation or an air-fluid level inside of a cavitary lesion, indicating that the abscess cavity communicated with a bronchiole. Bronchiole communication occurs in most patients with lung abscess. Chest CT will diagnose cavitary lesions with and without bronchiolar communication. Conditions that may appear cavitary on a chest radiograph include infected bullae, pleural fluid collection with bronchopleural fistula, loop of bowel extending through a diaphragmatic hernia, hiatal hernia, and objects lying on or behind the patient at the time of the radiograph. Causes of other cavitary lung lesions are noted in Table 2. Laboratory results are nonspecific.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h3>Treatment</h3>
    <p>After stabilization of immediate life-threatening conditions, the next step is usually antibiotic therapy. Empiric therapy targets anaerobes and facultatively anaerobic streptococci.<sup>22</sup> Ampicillin-sulbactam, 3 grams IV every 6 hours, or a carbapenem (imipenem, meropenem) are appropriate choices.<sup>20,22</sup> Clindamycin is another option but is often avoided due to the risk of subsequent infection with <em>Clostridium difficile</em>.<sup>22</sup> Clindamycin plus a cephalosporin is another option.<sup>17</sup></p>
    <p>Drainage usually occurs spontaneously from communication of the abscess cavity with the tracheobronchial tree. This is signaled by the development of an air-fluid level on the chest radiograph.</p>
    <p>Patients who fail to respond to antibiotics are candidates for percutaneous or transbronchial drainage or open drainage of the abscess cavity. Approximately 11% to 21% of lung abscesses require surgical or percutaneous drainage.<sup>18</sup> The overall success rate of percutaneous drainage of lung abscess is 84%, with a complication rate of 16%.<sup>23</sup> Percutaneous abscess drainage with CT or US guidance is a simple method to drain the abscess cavity and provides more accurate material for culture of causative organism.<sup>24</sup> Transbronchial drainage carries the complication of possible contamination of the unaffected lung. Open surgical techniques can resect the lung abscess.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h3>Disposition</h3>
    <p>Admit patients with newly diagnosed lung abscesses for antibiotic treatment. Reserve surgical interventions for large or complicated abscesses or for those failing antibiotic treatment (Box 1).</p>
