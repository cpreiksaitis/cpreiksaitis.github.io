    <h1>Temporomandibular Joint Disorder and Dislocation</h1>

    <h2>Foundations</h2>
    <h3>Anatomy, Physiology, and Pathophysiology</h3>
    <p>The TMJ is the articulation between the squamous portion of the temporal bone and the condyle of the mandible. It is comprised of two types of synovial joints: hinge and sliding. The hinge joint action dominates during normal mouth opening, but with wide opening, translational movement occurs and the articular disc and condyle complex slide inferiorly (Fig. 1). When the condyle moves anterior to the articular eminence, dislocation occurs.</p>

        With slight opening, the joint’s function as a hinge predominates. With greater jaw opening, there is translational movement.<br>

    <h3>Temporomandibular Joint Disorder</h3>
    <p>The cause of TMD is debated, but jaw clenching and grinding associated with stress is thought to contribute. Tooth malocclusion was previously thought to be a common etiology, but this is rare unless there is an inciting event (e.g., if symptoms began after dental work with resultant malocclusion).</p>
    <h3>Temporomandibular Joint Dislocation</h3>
    <p>TMJ dislocation occurs when the condyle travels anteriorly along the eminence and becomes locked in the anterosuperior aspect of the eminence. The masseter, internal pterygoid, and temporalis go into spasm attempting to close the mandible; trismus results and the condyle cannot return to the temporal fossa. Mandibular dislocation is painful and frightening for the patient. Patients prone to mandibular dislocation include individuals with anatomic disharmonies between the fossa and articular eminence, weakness of the capsule and the temporomandibular ligaments, or torn ligaments. Dystonic reaction to drugs may result in mandibular dislocation. Patients who have had one episode of mandibular dislocation are predisposed to further dislocations. If a unilateral dislocation has occurred, the jaw deviates to the opposite side. More commonly, a symmetrical bilateral dislocation occurs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Clinical Features</h2>
    <h3>Temporomandibular Joint Disorder</h3>
    <p>TMD is defined as “aching in the muscles of mastication, sometimes with occasional brief severe pain on chewing, often associated with restricted jaw movement and clicking or popping sounds.” Patients may also report headache, facial pain, or even an earache. Pain is often precipitated by use of the muscles of mastication (e.g., chewing) or with increased ranging of the TMJ (e.g., laughing, yawning).</p>
    <p>For TMDs, the main physical signs are related to three items: joint sounds, such as crepitus or a joint click upon range of motion; limitations of joint movements with pain during assisted maximum mouth opening; and muscle and joint pain and pain just anterior to the auricular canal. None of these findings alone has sufficient testing characteristics to rule TMD in or out, however. The diagnostic criteria of TMJ are outside the scope of this article.</p>
    <h3>Temporomandibular Joint Dislocation</h3>
    <p>The mandibular condyles may dislocate from trauma, but more often, dislocation follows extreme opening of the mandible, such as the case with yawning. Patients may have had prolonged jaw opening, such as in the case of dental procedures. They will report not being able to close the mouth. Recurrent dislocations are common, and patients may present knowing they have an anterior dislocation. Verbalization of their symptoms is often difficult because their mouth is stuck open.</p>
    <p>On examination, jaw dislocations easy to recognize. The jaw will not be able to be closed, and a depression can be felt and seen in the preauricular area. There may be the appearance of an underbite as the mandible is anteriorly displaced. Asymmetry suggests a unilateral dislocation. If a traumatic mechanism is suspected, a secondary survey for trauma should be initiated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Differential Diagnoses</h2>
    <p>The diagnosis of a TMJ dislocation is straightforward. However, TMD has many presenting complaints and therefore consideration for other etiologies is warranted. Pain can be secondary to pulpitis, an odontogenic infection, headache, otitis media, sinusitis, parotitis, and trigeminal neuralgia.</p>
    <h2>Diagnostic Testing</h2>
    <p>Radiographs are not indicated for straight-forward nontraumatic dislocation, unless the diagnosis is not certain. In cases of traumatic dislocation, obtain either a panoramic view of the mandible (Panorex) or CT scan of the facial to exclude fracture before manipulating.</p>
    <h2>Management</h2>
    <h3>Temporomandibular Joint Disorder</h3>
    <p>Patients with TMD often have symptoms that fluctuate over time, and therefore initial therapy is conservative. NSAIDs, application of heat or cooling, and consideration of bite guards, if the patient has bruxism, are all reasonable first-line therapies. Heat therapy is typically 15 minutes at a time, four to six times daily. Refractory cases can also benefit from diazepam (2 to 5 mg by mouth every 8 hours as needed). If the symptoms are more severe, referral to a specialist is warranted because a multidisciplinary approach is often necessary to manage symptoms. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation therapy or surgery may benefit patients with refractory cases.</p>
    <h3>Temporomandibular Joint Dislocation</h3>
    <p>Reduction of a dislocated mandible is often difficult, because masseter muscle contraction must be overcome. To relax the masseter, procedural sedation and analgesia is necessary. Either facing the patient or from behind, the emergency clinician grasps the mandible with both hands; the thumbs rest on the ridge of the mandible intraorally, posterior to the molars, and the fingers wrap around the outside of the jaw. It is best to have the patient sitting up, with a firm surface behind the head, so that posterior and inferior pressure can be exerted without accompanying movement of the patient’s entire head. This method is effective and also prevents being inadvertently bitten by the patient since the reduction is extraoral.<sup>19</sup>  Some physicians prefer an intraoral approach and place the thumbs on the occlusal surfaces of the teeth. In this case, the thumbs are wrapped with gauze and fortified with a piece of wooden tongue blade to protect them when reduction is accomplished, because the masseter muscles can contract with tremendous force.</p>
    <p>Firm, progressive, downward pressure is applied on the mandible to free the condyles from the anterior aspect of the eminence; the mandible is guided caudally, then posteriorly and superiorly back into the temporal fossae (Fig. 2). If this maneuver is unsuccessful, both hands can be used on the affected side of the mandible. The patient is advised to avoid extreme opening of the mandible, such as occurs during laughing and yawning, to begin a soft diet for 1 week, and to apply warm compresses in the TMJ area. NSAIDs and muscle relaxants may be helpful. Patients with chronic dislocation may be helped initially with the application of a Barton bandage (elastic fabricated bandage that wraps around the top of the head and mandible)</p>

    <h5>Fig 2: Reduction of Temporomandibular Joint Dislocation.<br>
        The temporomandibular joint is illustrated in normal and dislocated positions. (A) Closed position, with the mandibular condyle resting in the mandibular fossa behind the articular eminence. (B) In maximally open position, the mandibular condyle is just under and slightly behind the articular eminence. (C) In dislocated position, the mandibular condyle moves forward and upward slightly above the articular eminence; muscle spasm then occurs. (D) For reduction of dislocation, the thumbs are placed intraorally and lateral to the lower molars, and pressure is applied to the lower molar ridge area near the jaw angle in a downward and backward direction. (E) When the mandibular condyle has cleared the articular eminence, muscle contraction returns the jaw to a normal closed position.

    <p>A hands-free approach for reduction of acute nontraumatic TMJ dislocation using a “syringe” technique has also been described. With this technique, a 5- or 10-mL syringe is placed between the posterior upper and lower molars (or gums if edentulous) on the affected side. The patient then gently bites down and rolls the syringe back and forth; the syringe is a rolling fulcrum that helps the anteriorly-displaced condyle slip back into its normal position.</p>

    <h2>Disposition</h2>
    <p>Patients with TMD and with TMJ dislocation who have been relocated can be discharged home. Those with irreducible TMJ dislocation or those with TMJ dislocation in conjunction with a fracture are candidates for specialty consultation and may require admission for surgical reduction and fixation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="answer">Answer: d.</div>
        <div class="answer-explanation">TMJ radiographs are not helpful. Treatment consists of the external application of heat for 15 minutes four to six times per day, soft diet, analgesics including NSAIDs, and consideration of a muscle relaxant, such as diazepam (2 to 10 mg up to four times per day). Patients should be referred to a dentist specializing in TMD, such as a periodontist or a periodontal prosthodontist.</div>
