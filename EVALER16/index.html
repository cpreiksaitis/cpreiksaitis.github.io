    <h3>Introduction and Epidemiology</h3>
    <p>Spinal epidural abscess is a collection of pyogenic material that accumulates in the epidural space between the dura and vertebral periosteum and often leads to devastating neurologic outcomes.<sup>1,2</sup> The incidence of spinal epidural abscess has doubled in the past two decades, largely attributed to factors such as an increasing proportion of immunocompromised patients, more prevalent IV drug use, an increasing number of spinal procedures, and improved imaging modalities for detection.<sup>3,4</sup> Despite improvement in diagnosis and treatment, mortality remains high at 2% to 20%.<sup>1</sup> <em>S. aureus</em> is the most commonly involved bacteria and is responsible for 70% of cases, with a higher proportion of methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> seen in patients with implantable devices.<sup>1,4</sup> Other pathogens include <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis</em>, streptococcal species, and gram-negative bacilli, which is especially prevalent in IV drug users. Mycobacteria and fungi causing spinal epidural abscess are rare. Tuberculosis spinal epidural abscess, also known as Pott’s disease, is seen in areas where tuberculosis remains endemic and in the immunocompromised population.<sup>5</sup></p>
    <h3>Pathophysiology</h3>
    <p>Spinal epidural abscess can arise from hematogenous spread through blood circulation with soft tissue, urine, and respiratory infections contributing in the majority of cases. In general, hematogenously spread epidural abscesses are more likely to be found in the posterior epidural space.<sup>4</sup> Less commonly, spinal epidural abscesses are caused by direct extension from infected adjacent tissue, such as vertebral spondylodiscitis or vertebral osteomyelitis, which occurs when areas of slow blood flow in the vertebral body end plates are occluded by venous or arterial septic emboli, causing osteonecrosis.<sup>6</sup> Direct extension typically infects the anterior portion of the spinal column.<sup>1,7</sup> Fifteen to 22% of spinal epidural abscesses are caused iatrogenically from neurosurgical procedures, including percutaneous diagnostic and therapeutic techniques.<sup>4</sup> Trauma contributes to a small proportion of spinal epidural abscesses, with the remainder of cases without an identifiable source.<sup>3,4</sup></p>
    <p>Most spinal epidural abscesses affect the thoracic and lumbar spine, where the epidural space is wider with a larger venous plexus. The cervical spine is affected only 5% to 20% of the time, although morbidity and neurologic devastation are much greater than in thoracic or lumbar locations.<sup>8</sup></p>
    <p>Mechanisms for spinal cord neurologic sequelae are uncertain and are thought to be from a combination of direct compression from the abscess itself, ischemia due to compression of spinal veins and arteries, and septic thrombophlebitis.<sup>1</sup></p>

    <h3>Clinical Features</h3>
    <p>Back pain is the most common presenting complaint and is seen in the majority of cases. Fever is another common symptom, followed by the presence of a neurologic deficit. However, the classic triad of back pain, fever, and neurologic symptoms is seen in a minority of patients (8% to 37%).<sup>1,4</sup> Typically, patients with spinal epidural abscess progress through four stages in a period ranging from hours to days. Stage 1 consists of back pain, fever, and localized spinal tenderness. Stage 2 is composed of spinal irritation, including radicular pain, hyperreflexia, and nuchal rigidity. Stage 3 involves the bowel and bladder, with symptoms of fecal or urinary incontinence, as well as focal neurologic deficits such as motor weakness. Finally, in stage 4, paralysis ensues.<sup>1,4</sup> Patients with tuberculosis as an etiology may also endorse night sweats and weight loss.<sup>9</sup></p>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Screen any patient presenting with back pain, fever, or neurologic complaint for spinal epidural abscess. Patients may have a history of chronic back pain or may offer a mechanism of mild trauma, which can distract from a diagnosis of spinal epidural abscess. Similarly, neck pain or stiffness is often thought to be meningitis or encephalitis, causing cervical spinal epidural abscess to be overlooked.</p>
    <p>Carefully search for back pain red flags in the patient’s history, including immunocompromised states and immunosuppressant medications. Elicit a history of recent systemic illness or infection. Inquire about travel and history of tuberculosis. Ask about any current or former IV drug use, which can make patients higher risk for spinal epidural abscess development from Pseudomonas species. Solicit information about prior spinal surgeries or procedures, including LPs, epidurals, spinal injections, or epidural anesthesia. Ask about any changes in bowel or bladder habits, specifically episodes of bladder fullness or urinary or fecal incontinence.<sup>4,10</sup></p>
    <h3>Physical Examination</h3>
    <p>Perform a thorough physical examination starting with a general assessment of sources of infection. Palpate the spine, searching for tenderness to palpation, especially in the midline, which may suggest spinal epidural abscess. Complete a full neurologic examination, including sensory dermatome testing and motor evaluation including ambulation. Check reflexes for hyper- or areflexia. Evaluate for symptoms of cauda equina syndrome. Perform a rectal examination looking for decreased rectal tone, which has a sensitivity of 60% to 80%, and an evaluation of perianal sensation for saddle anesthesia, which has a sensitivity of 75%.<sup>11</sup></p>

    <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
    <p>Diagnosis is delayed in many patients with spinal epidural abscess due to nonspecific presenting symptoms and the rarity of diagnosis. Send blood for laboratory studies including blood culture, CBC, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein. Leukocytosis is seen in only 60% to 78% of patients and is not sensitive or specific enough for a diagnosis of spinal epidural abscess.<sup>4</sup> Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is much more sensitive and, in one study, was elevated in 110 of 117 patients diagnosed with spinal epidural abscess.<sup>4</sup> C-reactive protein has the advantage of rising faster than erythrocyte sedimentation rate and returns to normal sooner as well, but some labs have a delay in resulting C-reactive protein. Do not withhold further diagnostics and treatment pending C-reactive protein.<sup>4</sup> Blood cultures are positive in up to 60% of cases and may be helpful for inpatient teams.<sup>4</sup> Do not perform LP if there is suspicion for spinal abscess. CSF culture is positive less than a quarter of the time, and LP poses the risk of traversing an abscess and causing meningitis or a subdural infection.<sup>4</sup></p>
    <p>MRI with gadolinium is the gold standard imaging study for the diagnosis of spinal epidural abscess and has a sensitivity and specificity greater than 90%.<sup>7</sup> If MRI is not available, consider emergent transfer to an appropriate referral center. In patients with contraindications to MRI, CT with myelography can be useful to localize epidural compression but is limited in its ability to distinguish abscess from other compressive lesions.<sup>4</sup> Plain radiographs are not sensitive or specific for diagnosis of spinal epidural abscess.<sup>7</sup></p>

    <h3>Treatment</h3>
    <p>Once diagnosis has been established, prompt treatment is essential to reduce morbidity and enhance survival. Immediate consultation with a spine surgeon is paramount, and if a spine surgeon is not available, transfer to a referral center.<sup>4</sup> Neurologic outcome is correlated with degree of neurologic deficit prior to treatment.</p>
    <p>There are no conclusive data regarding surgery versus conservative antibiotic therapy, and practices vary considerably from immediate operative therapy to conservative IV antibiotic therapy.<sup>7</sup> Patients with neurologic deficits usually require evacuation of the abscess with decompressive laminectomy, debridement, and long-term IV antibiotics, and some studies have shown improved outcomes with emergent surgery.<sup>3</sup> Patients who are neurologically intact or who have had neurologic deficits for &gt;72 hours may be candidates for conservative treatment or CT-guided aspiration depending on the spinal surgeon’s practice, with the understanding that if they develop neurologic deficits or decompensate, immediate surgical therapy is likely required.<sup>3</sup></p>
    <p>Start empiric antibiotic therapy if there will be an unavoidable delay for surgery or if the patient exhibits neurologic dysfunction or signs of sepsis. Appropriate empiric antibiotics can include a combination of vancomycin, 15 to 20 milligrams/kg IV loading dose, to cover methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> along with an antipseudomonal β-lactam such as ceftazidime, 2 grams IV every 8 hours, cefepime, 2 grams IV every 8 hours, or meropenem, 2 grams IV every 8 hours.<sup>1,12</sup> Once cultures return, an infectious disease consult may be helpful to determine long-term antibiotic choice and duration.</p>
    <p>Admit patients diagnosed with spinal epidural abscess for spinal surgery. If the patient will receive conservative therapy, admit to the intensive care unit for close monitoring, neurologic checks, and further management in conjunction with the spinal surgery team.</p>
