    <h2>Foundations</h2>
    <p>Hypertension is observed in up to 8% of pregnancies and is generally divided into several categories<sup>1</sup>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gestational hypertension occurs during pregnancy, resolves during the postpartum period, and is recognized by a new blood pressure reading of 140/90 mm Hg or higher.</li>
        <li>Preeclampsia is gestational hypertension with proteinuria (&gt;300 mg/24 hr).</li>
        <li>Eclampsia is the occurrence of seizures in a patient with signs of preeclampsia. Progression of preeclampsia to eclampsia is unpredictable and can occur rapidly.</li>
        <li>Pregnancy-aggravated hypertension is chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia or eclampsia.</li>
        <li>Chronic or coincidental hypertension is present before pregnancy or persists for more than 6 weeks postpartum.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Approximately 2% to 7% of pregnancies are complicated by pregnancy-induced hypertension. The incidence of actual eclampsia has progressively declined but is still one of the major causes of maternal mortality. The risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension is greatest in women younger than 20 years, primigravidas and those with twin or molar pregnancies, those with hypercholesterolemia, pregestational diabetes, or obesity, or those with a family history of pregnancy-induced hypertension.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
    <p>Gestational hypertension or preeclampsia is a vasospastic disease of unknown cause unique to pregnant women. Vasospasm, ischemia, and thrombosis associated with preeclamptic changes cause injury to maternal organs, placental infarction and abruption, and fetal death from hypoxia and prematurity. The cause of eclampsia is unknown, but recent studies have centered on vascular responsiveness to endogenous vasopressors in the preeclamptic woman. Vascular responsiveness is normally depressed during pregnancy, which is a high-output, low-resistance state. Gestational hypertension is characterized by an even greater elevation in cardiac output, followed by an abnormally high peripheral resistance as clinical manifestations of the disease develop. In patients with preeclampsia, the cardiac output eventually drops as peripheral resistance rises. The cause of these changes is not known, but endothelial dysfunction is purported to release vasoactive mediators and result in vasoconstriction. Antiplatelet agents during pregnancy have been reported to reduce the risk of development of preeclampsia, supporting the premise of an imbalance between levels of thromboxane and prostacyclin in preeclampsia.<sup>1</sup></p>
    <p>The vasospastic effects of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia are protean. The intravascular volume is lower than in normal pregnancy, central venous pressures are normal, and capillary wedge pressures are variable. Liver effects are believed to be due to hepatocellular necrosis and edema resulting from vasospasm. Renal injury causes proteinuria and may result in decreased glomerular filtration. Microangiopathic hemolysis may result from vasospasm, causing thrombocytopenia. Central nervous system (CNS) effects include microvascular thrombosis and hemorrhage, as well as focal edema and hyperemia.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Clinical Features</h2>
    <h4>Signs and Symptoms</h4>
    <p>The patient with gestational hypertension has mild systolic or diastolic blood pressure elevation, no proteinuria, and no evidence of organ damage. Mental status assessment, testing of reflexes, abdominal examination, liver function studies, and coagulation studies yield normal results. Preeclampsia is associated with kidney changes and, in severe cases, other end-organ symptoms. Edema is often difficult to assess because pregnancy is normally associated with excess extracellular fluid and dependent edema, and it is no longer used as a criterion for preeclampsia. Proteinuria (300 mg/24 hr) is variable at any given time and may not be detectable in a random urine specimen.</p>
    <p>In cases of severe preeclampsia, the diastolic blood pressure can exceed 110 mm Hg, proteinuria is more severe, and there is evidence of vasospastic effects in various end organs. CNS effects commonly include headache or visual disturbances. In preeclampsia, the patient will become hyperreflexive before seizures develop. Thrombocytopenia may be present, liver function test findings may be elevated, and the liver is often tender. Renal dysfunction may be indicated by oliguria and elevated creatinine levels in addition to proteinuria.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Complications</h2>
    <p>The HELLP syndrome, a particularly severe form of preeclampsia that develops in 5% to 10% of women who have preeclamptic symptoms, is characterized by <span class="bold">h</span>emolysis, <span class="bold">e</span>levated <span class="bold">l</span>iver enzyme levels (alanine transaminase [ALT] and aspartate transaminase [AST] &gt; 70 U/L), and <span class="bold">l</span>ow <span class="bold">p</span>latelet count (&lt;100,000/mL). Prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen are normal, and blood studies reveal microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Other complications of preeclampsia include spontaneous hepatic and splenic hemorrhage and abruptio placentae.</p>
    <p>The most dangerous complication is eclampsia, which is the occurrence of seizures or coma in the setting of signs and symptoms of preeclampsia. Warning signs for the development of eclampsia include headache, nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances. Elevated total leukocyte count, creatinine, and AST levels are also predictive of increased morbidity for the patient with severe preeclampsia. Particularly in early eclampsia before 32 weeks of gestation, seizures may develop abruptly, and hypertension may not be associated with edema or proteinuria. In postpartum women who have eclampsia, more than half (55%) have not been previously diagnosed with preeclampsia, and patients may present with headache, vision changes, elevated blood pressure, and seizures, often within 48 hours of delivery, but in up to 6 weeks after delivery and in rare cases up to 12 weeks postpartum.<sup>2</sup> After 48 hours postpartum and without predelivery signs of preeclampsia, other diagnoses, such as intracranial hemorrhage, should be considered. Maternal complications of eclampsia include permanent CNS damage from recurrent seizures or intracranial bleeding, renal insufficiency, and death.</p>
    <p>The maternal mortality rate from eclampsia has been reduced to less than 1% with modern management. Perinatal mortality has also decreased, although it remains at 4% to 8%.<sup>1</sup> Causes of neonatal death include placental infarcts, intrauterine growth retardation, and abruptio placentae. In addition, fetal hypoxia from maternal seizures and the complications of premature delivery contribute significantly to fetal morbidity and mortality.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Differential Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>Peripheral edema is common in normal pregnancy, and it may be difficult to differentiate normal edema from that of early preeclampsia. Differentiation of gestational hypertension from preexistent hypertension is often impossible if no record of normal blood pressure is available. Seizures during pregnancy may be due to epilepsy as well as other intracranial catastrophes, such as thrombosis or hemorrhage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Diagnostic Testing</h2>
    <p>The patient who has severe preeclampsia should have an IV line and fetal monitoring initiated. Blood testing includes a complete blood cell count, renal function studies, liver function tests, platelet count, coagulation profile, and a baseline magnesium level. The serum glucose concentration is determined in patients with seizures.</p>
    <p>If a history of preeclampsia is not obtained or the symptoms are refractory to magnesium sulfate therapy, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head is performed to exclude cerebral venous thrombosis or an intracranial hemorrhage, either of which can occur in pregnancy—with or without pregnancy-induced hypertension—and may require specific treatment. CT scan abnormalities can be seen in 50% of patients with eclampsia. Patchy hemorrhage and microinfarcts of the cortex are characteristic and may be due to loss of cerebral autoregulation in patients with severe pregnancy-related hypertension. Diffuse cerebral edema can also be seen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Management</h2>
    <h4>Mild Preeclampsia</h4>
    <p>The management of patients with mild preeclampsia includes documentation of blood pressure, reflexes, weight, and blood testing to ensure normal end-organ function. Accurate determination of gestational age by ultrasonography is needed to allow optimal management if symptoms progress. Limitation of physical activities, including bed rest, is the only demonstrated means of reducing blood pressure and allowing the pregnancy to be sustained longer. Definitive treatment is delivery of the fetus, although expectant management is standard in women at less than 34 weeks of gestation. Arrangement for close follow-up is important for patients who are not hospitalized.</p>
    <h4>Severe Preeclampsia</h4>
    <p>Hospitalization is recommended for patients with sustained hypertension above 140/90 mm Hg and signs of severe preeclampsia. Baseline laboratory studies are recommended to identify end-organ effects in the liver, kidney, and hematologic systems. Both diuresis and antihypertensive therapy have been remarkably unsuccessful in improving fetal outcome or prolonging pregnancy. However, admission does allow the obstetrician to assess fetal age and well-being accurately, maternal organ function, and effect of bed rest on blood pressure before the optimal timing of delivery is decided.</p>
    <p>Fulminant or severe preeclampsia, with marked blood pressure elevation (&ge;160/110 mm Hg) associated with epigastric or liver tenderness, visual disturbance, or severe headache, is managed in the same way as eclampsia (Box 1). The goal is prevention of seizures and permanent damage to maternal organs. Magnesium sulfate is given for seizure prophylaxis.</p>

    <p>Seizures and coma are the hallmarks of eclampsia, the ultimate consequence of preeclampsia. As in all seizure patients, hypoglycemia, drug overdose, and other causes of seizures should be excluded with appropriate tests. Eclamptic seizures are controlled in almost all patients by administering magnesium sulfate, although the mechanism of action remains elusive. Magnesium has little antihypertensive effect but is the most effective anticonvulsant, preventing recurrent seizures while maintaining uterine and fetal blood flow. The goals of magnesium sulfate therapy are to terminate ongoing seizures and prevent recurrence. An IV loading dose of 4 to 6 g magnesium given over 15 to 20 minutes, followed by 2 g/hr IV, is recommended. Magnesium administration should be accompanied by clinical observation for loss of reflexes (which occurs at ≈10 mg/dL) or respiratory depression (which occurs at levels of 12 mg/dL, although actual serum magnesium levels are rarely monitored). The infusion should be stopped if signs of hypermagnesemia (loss of reflexes or respiratory depression as manifest by a decrease in the respiratory rate or an increase in end tidal CO 2 are seen. IV calcium gluconate, 1 g given slowly, will reverse the adverse effects of hypermagnesemia.</p>
    <p>Despite ongoing controversy, the familiarity with magnesium sulfate and its physiologic advantages to the fetus, wide margin of safety, and high success rate in controlling seizures make it the first-line drug in patients with eclampsia. If seizures persist after the recommended doses of magnesium sulfate have been administered, the following agents may be used in the treatment of eclampsia in conjunction with obstetric consultation: lorazepam (2-4 mg IV for one dose, may repeat ×1 after 10-15 min), phenytoin or fosphenytoin (15-20 mg/kg IV ×1, may repeat at 10 mg/kg after 20 min), or levetiracetam (20-60 mg/kg IV, may repeat in 12 hours). In addition, a careful search for other causes of seizures (e.g., hypoglycemia and intracranial hemorrhage) should be instituted based on history and examination of the patient.<sup>3</sup></p>
    <p>Although magnesium sulfate is not a direct antihypertensive, the hypertension associated with eclampsia is often controlled adequately by stoppage of the seizures. Rapid lowering of blood pressure can result in uterine hypoperfusion, so specific antihypertensive treatment is initiated only if the diastolic blood pressure remains above 105 mm Hg or the systolic blood pressure remains above 160 mm Hg after control of seizures.<sup>4</sup> The goal is to lower maternal blood pressure by 15% to 20% with a systolic goal of 140 to 150 mm Hg and a diastolic goal of 90 to 100 mm Hg. Many patients do not require specific antihypertensive treatment after treatment with magnesium sulfate. The antihypertensives used most often by obstetricians are hydralazine (5-10 mg IV push, repeat q 2-4h) or labetalol (20 mg IV bolus, may repeat q10 min PRN up to 300 mg/total dose). Rapid-release nifedipine (10 mg PO) can be used if IV access is not immediately available. Other antihypertensive agents have not been well studied in this population because there are specific risks to uncontrolled lowering of blood pressure and loss of uteroplacental blood flow.</p>
    <p>Although total body water in the eclamptic patient is excessive, intravascular volume is contracted, and the eclamptic patient is sensitive to further volume changes. Hypovolemia results in decreased uterine perfusion. Thus, diuretics and hyperosmotic agents should be avoided in these patients. Invasive monitoring has demonstrated that vasospasm is not reversed with IV fluid administration. Rather, excessive IV fluids increase extravascular fluid stores that are difficult to mobilize postpartum, resulting in a higher incidence of pulmonary edema in patients treated aggressively with fluid therapy. Invasive pulmonary artery pressure monitoring may be required for accurate fluid management in the eclamptic patient.</p>
